### Welcome to Visual Computing Lab at IISc

Welcome to the Visual Computing Lab (VCL) at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. We are a part of Department of Computational and Data Sciences (CDS). The group was established in June 2017 with Anirban Chakraborty as the convenor. We are located in room 304 of CDS/SERC building (third floor).

We seek solutions to computer vision and machine learning problems arising in numerous application areas involving visual data analytics. These include knowledge distillation, human pose estimation, person re-identification in camera networks, super-resolution imaging, domain adaptation etc. to name a few. We are also keen to explore how visual analytics can be utilized in answering some of the most fundamental questions in biology and healthcare.
