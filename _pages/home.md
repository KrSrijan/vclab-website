### Welcome to Visual Computing Lab at IISc

We seek solutions to computer vision and machine learning problems arising in numerous application areas involving visual data analytics. These include knowledge distillation, human pose estimation, person re-identification in camera networks, super-resolution imaging, domain adaptation etc. to name a few. We are also keen to explore how visual analytics can be utilized in answering some of the most fundamental questions in biology and healthcare.
