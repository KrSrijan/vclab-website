  title: "Person Follower Mobile Robot"
  modal: personfollower
  abstract:  "Helper robots are widely used in various situations, for ex-ample at airports and railway stations. This paper presents a pipelineto multiplex the tracking and detection of a person in dynamic envi-ronments using a stereo camera in real-time. Recent developments inobject detection using ConvNets have led to robust person detection.These deep convolutional neural networks generally fail to run with highframes rates on devices with less computing power. Trackers are alsoused to retain the identity of the target person as well as imposefewerconstraints on hardware. A concept of multiplexed detection and tracking is used which makes the pipeline faster by many folds. TurtleBot-2is used for prototyping the robot and tuning of the motion controller.Robot Operating System (ROS) is used to set up communication be-tween various nodes of the pipeline. The results found were comparableto current state-of-the-art person followers and can be readily usedinday to day life."

  title: "Indian Number Plate Recognition"
  modal: numberplate
  abstract:  "Our current solution (implemented) provides a robust registration plate detection, and extracts other features like car model, speed, face (if visible), date and time of entry/exit and upload the extracted data to a centralized IoT integrated database. Beneficiaries include malls, colleges, parking lots, etc. with multiple gates. Whenever the gate camera detects a departing car, the corresponding owner gets notified. Further, the owner can use the Alert feature to warn the guard. The web application has two levels of access, the first providing general information about a specific car to the corresponding owner, and the latter one for the Authority, which stores all the data of a campus. This can be used to monitor the traffic on the campus and for surveillance applications."

  title: Solving Taxi v3 of OpenAi Gym
  modal: rl
  abstract: "There are four designated locations in the grid world indicated by R(ed), G(reen), Y(ellow), and B(lue). When the episode starts, the taxi starts off at a random square and the passenger is at a random location. The taxi drives to the passenger's location, picks up the passenger, drives to the passenger's destination (another one of the four specified locations), and then drops off the passenger. Once the passenger is dropped off, the episode ends. Observations:- There are 500 discrete states since there are 25 taxi positions, 5 possible locations of the passenger (including the case when the passenger is in the taxi), and 4 destination locations.This problem was solved using Q-Learning Approach. The model trained is consistently among top-5 in <a href=\"https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Leaderboard\">OpenAI Gym Leaderboard</a>"

  title: Self balancing Camera Platform
  modal: selfbalance
  abstract:  Control system is designed to stabilise the camera gimbal system used in different airborne systems for applications such as target tracking, surveillance, aerial photography, autonomous navigation and so on. The technique is applied in everything from self-stabilising cameras to helicopters and noise reducing equipment. This camera gimbal system replaces many traditional tracking systems such as radar which are heavy and large to mount on air vehicles. So, the stabilisation of camera gimbal is very important to eliminate shakes and vibrations in photography, provides accuracy. <br>NOTE- <i>This project was selected for SIH-20 from our internal hackathon conducted by college. Further details will be shared after results of SIH-20</i>

  title: Word Embedding Generation using NLP
  modal: wordemb
  abstract: Word embedding is the collective name for a set of language modeling and feature learning techniques in natural language processing (NLP) where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers.  Conceptually it involves a mathematical embedding from a space with many dimensions per word to a continuous vector space with a much lower dimension. Word2vec is a group of related models that are used to produce word embeddings. These models are shallow, two-layer neural networks that are trained to reconstruct linguistic contexts of words. Word2vec takes as its input a large corpus of text and produces a vector space, typically of several hundred dimensions, with each unique word in the corpus being assigned a corresponding vector in the space. Word vectors are positioned in the vector space such that words that share common contexts in the corpus are located close to one another in the space

  modal: mnist
  abstract: "<i> This Summer Project was mentored by me at IvLabs, VNIT</i> <br> The MNIST handwritten digit classification problem is a standard dataset used in computer vision and deep learning. Although the dataset is effectively solved, it can be used as the basis for learning and practicing how to develop, evaluate, and use convolutional deep learning neural networks for image classification from scratch. This includes how to develop a robust test harness for estimating the performance of the model, how to explore improvements to the model, and how to save the model and later load it to make predictions on new data. This was coded in scratch using Numpy. For more results and details about the algorithm visit the GitHub page. For full demo click the Video button"

  title: Harmonic Motion Analyser using MATLAB
  modal: harmonicmotion
  abstract:  Simple harmonic motion can serve as a mathematical model for a variety of motions, such as the oscillation of a spring. With the aim of learning computer vision and MATLAB, I worked on analyzing the motion of a target-object undergoing a damped harmonic motion. The target-object was separated from the background using color thresholding and estimated as a point object. Coordinates of this point were recorded and used to estimate the parameters associated with the mathematical model of the system like maximum displacement, mean position, the velocity at different time instants. A mathematical model was estimated by fitting a curve to the recorded data using MATLAB Curve Fitting Toolbox.
